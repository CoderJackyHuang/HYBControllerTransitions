# English Document  |  [中文文档](http://www.henishuo.com/transition-chinese-document/)

A very helpful and an very useful library for controller custom transition.

This is an open source library for developers to use custom transition,   
including push, pop, present and dismiss. In the library, now has supported  
many kind of animations that we can see in many apps. The best thing for this  
library is, that developers only need to call an API, without others, to support  
custom transition. For more information, just see the document in detail  
or just download the demo project to have a look.

# Goal

I design this library with a goal that any developer can use it directly without any knowledge   
about custom transition. For this, I try to make it as easy as it can. Almost all properties  
have default value, and just an API to call it out.

Though Developers have no foudation of custom transition, they can use it directly.
All custom transition protocols have been wraped in the base transtion, you still can use
it to add special effect. for this, just inherit from the HYBBaseTransition class.

# Version Changes

## Version 1.2.0

* Fix in ios7, it shows wrong in Lanscape.
* Add ease in ease out transition animations for push/pop、present/dismiss

## Version 1.1.0

* fix a bug that it will be black when pushed to a controller and then go toHome, it means enter into background. Now I have set the navigation controller's delegate to nil when it was poped.


## Version 1.0.1

* fix document




# Support Spring Animation

If you want to transition with Spring Animation, you can try this.

```
/**
 *	Default is NO, if set to YES, it will be presented and dismissed with
 *  spring animation.
 */
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL animatedWithSpring;
```

You can specify damp, initialSpringVerlocity, they have default values.

```
/**
 * The initial Spring velocity, Only when animatedWithSpring is YES, it will take effect.
 * Default is 1.0 / 0.5. If you don't know, just use the default value.
 */
@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat initialSpringVelocity;

/**
 *	The Spring damp, Only when animatedWithSpring is YES, it will take effect.
 *
 *  Default is 0.5. If you don't know, just use the default value.
 */
@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat damp;
```



# Buble Effect Transition

A custom modal transition that presents and dismiss a controller with an expanding bubble effect.  
The bubble transition only supports present and dismiis mode.

It's easy to use, just in the presenting controller callback event to add custom transition, like below:

```
- (void)onPresent {
  HYBBubbleFromBottomController *vc = [[HYBBubbleFromBottomController alloc] init];
  vc.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationCustom;
  
  // Remember to own it strongly
  // Because delegate is weak reference, and it will be released after out of the function body.
  self.bubbleTransition = [[HYBBubbleTransition alloc] initWithPresented:^(UIViewController *presented, UIViewController *presenting, UIViewController *source, HYBBaseTransition *transition) {
    // You need to cast type to the real subclass type.
    HYBBubbleTransition *bubble = (HYBBubbleTransition *)transition;
   
    // If you want to use Spring animation, set to YES.
    // Default is NO.
    //    bubble.animatedWithSpring = YES;
    bubble.bubbleColor = presented.view.backgroundColor;
    
    // If one have a navigation bar but another not, you should handle the difference by yourself.
    CGPoint center = [self.view viewWithTag:1010].center;
    center.y += 64;
    
    bubble.bubbleStartPoint = center;
  } dismissed:^(UIViewController *dismissed, HYBBaseTransition *transition) {
    // Do nothing and it is ok here.
    // If you really want to do something, here you can set the mode.
    // But inside the super class, it is set to be automally.
    // So you do this has no meaning.
    transition.transitionMode = kHYBTransitionDismiss;
  }];
  vc.transitioningDelegate = self.bubbleTransition;
  
  [self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:NULL];
}
```

For example, AController has an event onPresent, when it is clicked, it will be invoked.   
Now, AController needs to present BController, just use the code like above. In BController,  
you don't need to do anything. It is easy?

For more information, you should see the properties provided, almost every property has default value.  
So at many times, you don't need to worry about how to use.

# Modal Effect Transition

Modal transition animation, it will show usually half for the destination view controller's view,  
and scale the from view.

It only supports present and dismiss mode.

It is easy to use just like bubble effect transition. Only use an API to finish your job. It looks like below:  

```
- (void)onPresent {
  HYBBubbleFromBottomController *vc = [[HYBBubbleFromBottomController alloc] init];
  vc.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationCustom;
  
  // Remember to own it strongly
  // Because delegate is weak reference, and it will be released after out of the function body.
  self.bubbleTransition = [[HYBBubbleTransition alloc] initWithPresented:^(UIViewController *presented, UIViewController *presenting, UIViewController *source, HYBBaseTransition *transition) {
    // You need to cast type to the real subclass type.
    HYBBubbleTransition *bubble = (HYBBubbleTransition *)transition;
   
    // If you want to use Spring animation, set to YES.
    // Default is NO.
    //    bubble.animatedWithSpring = YES;
    bubble.bubbleColor = presented.view.backgroundColor;
    
    // If one have a navigation bar but another not, you should handle the difference by yourself.
    CGPoint center = [self.view viewWithTag:1010].center;
    center.y += 64;
    
    bubble.bubbleStartPoint = center;
  } dismissed:^(UIViewController *dismissed, HYBBaseTransition *transition) {
    // Do nothing and it is ok here.
    // If you really want to do something, here you can set the mode.
    // But inside the super class, it is set to be automally.
    // So you do this has no meaning.
    transition.transitionMode = kHYBTransitionDismiss;
  }];
  vc.transitioningDelegate = self.bubbleTransition;
  
  [self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:NULL];
}
```

For example, AController has an event onPresent, when it is clicked, it will be invoked.   
Now, AController needs to present BController, just use the code like above. In BController,  
you don't need to do anything. It is easy?

## Snapshot support navigation bar or not

When the presenting view controller has navigation bar, you should set it to YES, and default is YES.

```
/**
 *  Whether to include navigation bar when take scapshots.
 *	Default is YES. If NO, it has only the presenting view.
 */
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL scapshotIncludingNavigationBar;
```

## Support tap to dismiss automatically

If you don't want it to dismiss automatically, just set it to NO.  
The default value is YES.

```
/**
 *	When tap on the presenting view, should it automatically is dismissed.
 *
 *  Default is YES.
 */
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL shouldDismissOnTap;
```

For more information, you should see the properties provided, almost every property has default value.  
So at many times, you don't need to worry about how to use.

# Move Push/Pop Transition

The move transition animation, it looks like the transition animation of KeyNote move transition.  
When click a cell or a subview, then push to a view controller and you need  animation from the   
clicked view to the destination controller.  

It only supports push and pop mode.

![image](https://github.com/CoderJackyHuang/HYBControllerTransitions/blob/master/move.gif)

For the custom push/pop transition animation, it is much harder than present/dismiss. The reason it that,   
when a controller was pushed, at this time, we just call init method, but the target view to transition  
is nil, so I have to try to solve this problem.

Now, I use a UIController category to solve it. In the pushed view controller, just set a target view like this:

```
// You must specify a target view with this.
self.hyb_toTargetView = imgView;
```

Now we use just like this:

```
- (void)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView didSelectItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
  HYBMoveDetailController *vc = [[HYBMoveDetailController alloc] init];
  HYBGridModel *model = self.datasource[indexPath.item];
  vc.image = model.clipedImage;
  
  self.transition = [[HYBMoveTransition alloc] initWithPushed:^(UIViewController *fromVC, UIViewController *toVC, HYBBaseTransition *transition) {
    HYBMoveTransition *move = (HYBMoveTransition *)transition;
    HYBGridCell *cell = (HYBGridCell *)[collectionView cellForItemAtIndexPath:indexPath];
    move.targetClickedView = cell.imageView;
    
    move.animatedWithSpring = YES;
  } poped:^(UIViewController *fromVC, UIViewController *toVC, HYBBaseTransition *transition) {
    // Do nothing, unless you really need to.
  }];
  
  self.navigationController.delegate = self.transition;
  [self.navigationController pushViewController:vc animated:YES];
}
```

Here the example is that, when select a cell, transition from the cell's imageview to the target view (hyb_toTargetView).

Ok, until now, do you think it is really easy? I believe so!

# How to install

If your project supports Pod, just add the following code to you Podfile:

```
pod 'HYBControllerTransitions', '~> 1.0.0'
```

Otherwise, just add the source code HYBControllerTransitions folder to your project.
